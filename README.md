<h2 align="center">🚀 About Me</h2>

<!-- [My Portfolio Page](#)  Portfolio to be added when is getting hosted!-->

I’m a PhD student 🎓  in Information Technology with a strong academic foundation in Software Engineering (Bachelor’s) and Artificial Intelligence (Master’s), all pursued at Burgas Free University 🏛. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve developed a deep, hands-on understanding of a wide range of technologies.

💡 I'm a passionate learner, I’m constantly exploring new fields, embracing new challenges, and working across different technologies. My approach is simple: strive to be better than yesterday. ✨

👨🏻‍💻 My GitHub page includes several small side projectsthat I created in the gaps between work, studies, and my personal game development endeavors. While most of my game projects remain private, I’m excited to share my public repositories, which are free to download and reference if you find them helpful.
